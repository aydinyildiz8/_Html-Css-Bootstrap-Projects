      Few industry icons can claim the multitude of phenomenal successes that
      Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto can. Miyamoto's greatest creation,
      a character named Mario has reshaped the industry in many ways over the
      years. With the coming launch of Super Mario Sunshine, GameCubicle takes a
      look back at the history of Mario, from Miyamoto's first sketch of Mario
      to the character's domination of the video game universe... <br /><br>

      Shigeru Miyamoto <br />

      Shigeru Miyamoto grew up in a modest home in Sonebe, Japan. An artist from
      his youngest years, Miyamoto took great joy in drawing and painting.
      Miyamoto's interests in art only increased over the years and he spent
      much time filling sketch pads with scenes of nature, creating puppets,
      constructing models, and creating lively characters through cartoon
      flip-books. <br /><br>

      Miyamoto was also an adventurer and often took off to explore local
      creeks, fields, mountains, and forests. On one of his many outdoor
      adventures, Miyamoto came upon a dark cave in a hillside near his home. He
      eventually got up the nerve to explore it and with a lantern, climbed
      inside. Miyamoto still recalls the experience as one of the most
      exhilarating of his childhood. <br /><br>

      In 1970, Miyamoto began attending Kanazawa Munici College of Industrial
      Arts and Crafts. He continued his many hobbies throughout college and even
      taught himself to play the guitar. Being an incessant daydreamer, Miyamoto
      never paid much attention in his classes and it took him five years to
      graduate with a degree in industrial design. <br /><br>

      Following his graduation, Miyamoto asked his father to contact his old
      friend Hiroshi Yamauchi, then president of Nintendo, to request an
      interview. Yamauchi hired Miyamoto as Nintendo's first staff artist in
      1977. <br />

      The Game that Saved NOA <br /><br>

      Recognizing the business opportunities that an emerging North American
      arcade market offered, Hiroshi Yamauchi found an imperative in developing
      an independent Nintendo subsidiary in North America. In 1977, Yamauchi
      turned to his son-in-law Minoru Arakawa to lead the new firm. After much
      consideration, Arakawa accepted Yamauchi's offer and moved from Vancouver
      to Manhattan where he set up Nintendo of America's first office. <br />

      Arakawa's primary task was to break Nintendo into America's coin-operated
      arcade business. Nintendo of America (NOA) found only failure in its early
      efforts to meet this task (see: Space Fever and Sheriff). Impressed by the
      early success of a new arcade machine called Radarscope and in desperate
      need of a hit, Arakawa boldly ordered 3,000 Radarscope machines. Only
      1,000 units sold through to arcade owners and the Radarscope operation
      proved disastrous. <br /><br>

      Finding little success in the North American arcade market, Nintendo of
      America was in a desperate situation. Arakawa decided it would be best to
      move the subsidiary's headquarters closer to NCL and thought Seattle to be
      the best location. <br /><br>

      With Nintendo's best designers occupied on more important projects for the
      Japanese market, Yamauchi turned to young Nintendo artist Shigeru Miyamoto
      to design a coin-op arcade game that would bring success to Nintendo's
      efforts in North America. The imaginative Miyamoto conceived a story
      involving an angry gorilla that escapes from his master, kidnapping the
      master's girlfriend and taking her to the top of a construction site.
      Players control the master as he ascends the building, a factory, and a
      steel foundation, trying to save his girlfriend. <br /><br>

      In designing the game's hero, Miyamoto sought to create a silly character
      with whom gamers could connect. He designed a pudgy carpenter with a
      rounded nose and wide eyes. The low resolution of video game displays at
      the time, in addition to hardware limitations of the Radarscope sets on
      which Donkey Kong would run, required Miyamoto to make a few adjustments
      so that gamers could discern the character's features. To make the
      carpenter easily visible, Miyamoto outfitted him with colorful overalls
      and shirt. A mustache was drawn in to distinguish the his large nose.
      Finally, a red cap was added because programmers found it difficult to
      create the hair movement that would occur when the character jumped. In
      the end, Miyamoto settled on the name Jumpman for the carpenter and Donkey
      Kong for his pet gorilla, believing that 'donkey' translated into stubborn
      or silly in English. <br />
